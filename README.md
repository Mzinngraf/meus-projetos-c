# Marco's Coding Journey

**From copying code to understanding code**

## About My Journey

I started programming like many others: copying and pasting from the internet. 
But I realized that wouldn't take me far. Now my focus is **understanding every line of code I write** - 
knowing the "why" behind every "how".

My motto: "If I can't explain it, I don't truly understand it."

## Projects

### [LIBFT](libs/libft/) - My First Real Victory
- **Status:** Complete (Grade: 125/100)
- **The Challenge:** Implement 40+ libc functions from scratch
- **Key Learnings:** 
  - Split was the most challenging - understanding how to combine multiple helper functions
  - Linked lists - where pointers finally made sense
  - Makefile - automation has logical foundations

- **Achievement:** For the first time, I felt I truly understood what I was building

## Goals

### Short Term:
- Complete ft_printf understanding every specifier
- Learn GDB for proper debugging  
- Understand memory leaks in practice

### Long Term:
- Become a backend/security developer
- Contribute to open source projects
- Never stop learning

## Coding Philosophy

- Understanding > Copying
- Simple > Complex (when possible)
- Testing > Assuming
- Asking > Getting stuck

## Currently Studying
- C (deepening knowledge)
- Algorithms
- Security fundamentals
- How computers work under the hood
